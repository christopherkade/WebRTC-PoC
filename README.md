# WebRTC PoC

A basic use of WebRTC to create a P2P connection between two clients on two different machines (or browsers).

## How to use it

Install the dependency:  
`npm install`

Start the Node server:  
`npm start`

Open the client in two different browsers or tabs:  
`open client/index.html`

Open your console to follow along and:

- Define the usernames of both clients
- On one client, trigger the connection by inputting the second client's username
- You can now send messages from one client to the other thanks to WebRTC !
